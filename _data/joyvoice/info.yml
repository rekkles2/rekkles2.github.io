        details: "军人晏清因执行任务频繁受伤，好友梁枕安为他的健康深感担忧。长期的工作压力让梁枕安出现严重失眠并求诊心理医生；在与医生交谈的过程中，他不断在现实与记忆之间往返，回溯与晏清自幼相识的过往。随着回忆与对话逐步揭开真相，梁枕安才被迫面对一个残酷事实——晏清在一次最后的任务中牺牲，这些日子里他所见到的晏清不过是自己心中痛苦的幻影。"
        details_en: "Yan Qing, a soldier, is repeatedly wounded on duty; his friend Liang Zhen’an grows ever more worried about his condition. Burdened by work stress, Liang develops severe insomnia and consults a psychotherapist. During their sessions—interwoven with memories of a friendship that began in childhood—Liang seeks the root of his sleeplessness. Piece by piece, the conversations and recollections force him to confront a devastating truth: Yan Qing died on his final mission, and the presence Liang has been experiencing is a projection of his own grief."
