    <p>
    Doing research allows me to develop techniques that can be used to help people.
    It gives me a strong sense of achievement and deep enjoyment, 
    particularly when combined with my other interests and creative skills.

    Two years ago, during my first research project, our group began exploring 
    applications of federated learning (FL). 
    I was tasked with deploying a video anomaly detection (VAD) 
    model on an NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier and training it via federated learning. 
    Because our team lacked prior research experience, I proceeded via independent, 
    self-guided exploration.

    <p>
    The main difficulties came from running on an ARM-based edge platform: 
    missing aarch64 prebuilt packages, recurring version conflicts across 
    JetPack/CUDA/cuDNN/PyTorch, and limited support for certain communication stacks on Jetson. 
    I evaluated multiple federated-learning frameworks but 
    repeatedly ran into dependency and protocol hurdles.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Through persistent debugging, careful version pinning, 
    and adopting the Flower framework for its flexibility, 
    I achieved a stable end-to-end deployment.
    I also open-sourced a detailed 
    <a href='https://github.com/rekkles2/Fed_WSVAD/blob/main/Fed_VAD/Jetson%20AGX%20Xavier%20Deployment%20Guide.md' class='inline-link'>Jetson AGX Xavier Deployment Guide for Federated Learning via Flower Framework</a>. 
    To the best of my knowledge, these results were among the first Fed-VAD 
    deployments on edge devices.

- question: "Why do you plan to shift your research field?"
  answer: >-
    <p>
    I am broadly interested in multimodal foundation models, 
    spanning representation learning and generative modeling for content creation. 
    My undergraduate studies on video anomaly detection and federated learning 
    applications are just the starting point.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    My motivation is both curiosity-driven. And I believe that in life we should 
    find something we are truly adept at.
    Finding a unique strength that only we can do well. Building on this mindset,
    So I aim to leverage my experience in voice dubbing and sound design to strengthen
    multimodal understanding and advance human–AI collaboration.

    I welcome discussions on new ideas and collaborations.

      <li> I mentored a master's student, Jiawen Jiang (<a href="mailto:231612093@sust.edu.cn" class="inline-link">231612093@sust.edu.cn</a>), who published his first paper at IJCNN 2025.</li>
      <li> I also mentored an undergraduate student, 
      Xiaomei Li (<a href="mailto:li_xiaomei0804@163.com" class="inline-link">li_xiaomei0804@163.com</a>), 
      who published her first paper at a domestic conference; 
      I further provided mock-interview simulations and technical mentoring to support her postgraduate recommendation to Beijing University of Technology (BJUT), a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_211" class="inline-link">Project 211</a> university.</li>
